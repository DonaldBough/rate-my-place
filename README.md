# Overview
In the middle of Covid by sister in law had a hard time finding a trustworthy apartment in New York, made more difficult by not being able to visit them in person.

Rate My Place lets renters rate their landlord/management company so apartment seekers can find trustworthy locations without ever visiting. We ended up not marketing the idea since we found out most other people preferred visiting the general area in person.

This was my first project where I didn't focus on making the code clean, and instead focused on finishing something quickly to see if the idea would be valuable to others.
